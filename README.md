# rGRIB
GRIB interface for R using the [ECMWF GRIB API](http://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/GRIB/Home)

#### Purpose
This project was started to address a need to easily read GRIB data into R as has been done in other languages (e.g., Python). Working on this also presents a great opportunity to learn more about R, C, and the interface between the two.

####Status
Currently, not much has been done other than to create some basic C functions and R wrappers to open and close files. Much can change as I learn more of the intricacies of the GRIB API. R's S3 objects will be implemented in this project for simplicity.
